Added deleteNetblock to match storeNetblock.

and findAllNetblocks().

Kevin Baker <kevin@apnic.net> sent in patches that suggested a new
handling of error conditions; extra error conditions to test for; and
a test script to exercise the error conditions.

Bruce Peikon <Bruce.Peikon@msdw.com> sent a contribution which suggested
that enumerate could do so by network.

Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com> sent in code that suggested the

Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de> contributed a function to test an IP
address and a block to test see if the IP address is in the block. 
Accordingly, there is now a match() method.

Rob Walker <rob@varesearch.com> contributed a function to return the
first usable adress in a block.  Instead of using that, I added a function
to return the nth address in a block.  There is now an nth() function.

Jean-Luc Szpyrka <Jean-Luc.Szpyrka@sophia.inria.fr> requested that a
function be provided that returns the oposite of a netmask.  Accordingly,
there is now the hostmask() method.
