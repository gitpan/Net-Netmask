Martin Lorensen <martin@lorensen.dk>: make 'any' a synonym for
'default'.  

Bugfix (aslo from Martin): fix the require to accept 5.6.1

= 2003/05/26 1.9003

Roman Shishkin <roman@rt.mipt.ru> provided several (public exported)
functions for looking at network tables:
	dumpNetworkTable()
	checkNetblock()
Inspired: changing findOuterNetblock() so it can take a block
as it's IP address.

Bugfix: notice that '218.0.0.0 - 221.255.255.255' isn't a valid
netmask.  Reported by Dan Wright <wright@smx.pair.com>.

Bugfix: could not specify network '0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255'.  Fix
from Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com>.

Added ->sameblock() from Martin Lorensen <martin@lorensen.dk>

Added ->cmpblocks().

Added overloaded stringification so that blocks stringify to their
description.

Added overloaded block comparision so that blocks can be compared and
sorted.

Added hostmask syntax a.b.c.d#hostmask - Martin Lorensen <martin@lorensen.dk>

Bugfix: t/badnets.t was missing from the MANIFEST.

Some spelling and typo mistakes fixed in the documentation.

Change the license to make the Debian folks happy.  Interface through
Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>.

= 2001/09/29

Sapient Fridge <sapient.fridge@WaCkY.zzn.com> and Alexander Karptsov
<karp@visti.net> sent a patch for a bug in range2cidrlist.  The
last IP in the range was skipped.

Sam Denton <sdenton@wantec.com> requested support for 
a.b.c.d/mask.mask.mask.mask.

Sam also sent a request that I include the world's fastest
sort-by-ip-address-in-perl function in Net::Netmask as there didn't
seem to be a better place to put it.  I've included it.  The function
in question was found/benchmarked by John Porter and written about
in the Perl-Users Digest, Issue 3860, Volume 8.

Sam sent a patch to eliminate a couple of trailing spaces in
the error codes.

My IP address are now 216.240.32/19 instead of 140.174.82/19 and
thus I've changed the examples in the pod.  :-)

= 2001/05/15

Added deleteNetblock to match storeNetblock.

Carol Lerche <cafl@securify.com> contributed findOuterNetblock()
and findAllNetblocks().

Kevin Baker <kevin@apnic.net> sent in patches that suggested a new
handling of error conditions; extra error conditions to test for; and
a test script to exercise the error conditions.

Bruce Peikon <Bruce.Peikon@msdw.com> sent a contribution which suggested
that enumerate could do so by network.

Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com> sent in code that suggested the 
creation of cidrs2contiglists() and range2cidrlist().

A couple of documentation fixes from Igor Vinokurov <igor@rtsnet.ru>.

Modified the match() method to return the position within the block.

= 1999/09/15

Added support for understanding network blocks in the form that the
whois database uses: FirstIP-LastIP.

= 1999/03/27

Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de> contributed a function to test an IP
address and a block to test see if the IP address is in the block. 
Accordingly, there is now a match() method.

Rob Walker <rob@varesearch.com> contributed a function to return the
first usable adress in a block.  Instead of using that, I added a function
to return the nth address in a block.  There is now an nth() function.

= 1998/11/29

Jean-Luc Szpyrka <Jean-Luc.Szpyrka@sophia.inria.fr> requested that a
function be provided that returns the oposite of a netmask.  Accordingly,
there is now the hostmask() method.
